This application has a user interphase, you can sign up and login into your account. The "feeds" page 
displays all reviews and tickets created from all users. The first part are the reviews and the lower 
part are the created tickets, which are waiting to get a review. On the "feeds" page and on the "posts" 
page there are the buttons to create a review ("Create a review") and to create a ticket ("Ask for a review"). 
The tap "posts" includes all reviews and tickets which the logged-in user has created. The user can modify 
and delete their own reviews and tickets. On the "abo" page you can search for a user and follow them.
